### Data Prep Cheat Sheet

#### How did you decide to start writing down content?

We decided to first brainstorm the steps that we thought were required in order to properly prepare data.  Topics were vocalized extemporaneously as they were thought of.  This could be met with a nod or a further discussion of whether it was in the purview of what we were being asked.  If a conscientious was reached it was added to the board.

#### How did you decide to organize your content?

Once we had brainstormed all the steps we shifted the discussion to their correct order. We went in the order of start to finish debating each topic presented in its final place.  Once all of the topics were numbered we then proceeded to create our flowchart.

#### What pre-existing knowledge or expierences did you rely on?

Some data types are just immensely easier to work with than others.  I also brought up adding additional columns but after further discussion it was decided that didn't fall into the purview of preparing the data.
