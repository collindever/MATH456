### Mathematical Models

We want to see how two variables are related

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \varepsilon_i$$
$$\varepsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$$
$$\varepsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$

This means the error (residuals) are independent of each other and normally distrubuted.  This applies even when we have more that two variables it just is extedning to multi-diminesional space.  **The Goal is to Minimize the Error (residuals)**

#### Example

We want to model an equation where Lung effective volume is our dependent variable and are independent variables are Age and Height

**Model**

$$y \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2$$

```{r}
#mv_model <- lm(FFEV1 ~ FAGE + FHEIGHT, data = fev)
#confit(mv_model)
```

**Equation**

$$y = -0.027X_1 + .114X_2 - 2.76$$

**Interpretation**

Holding height constant, a father who is one year older is expected to have a FEV value 0.03 (0.01, 0.04) litres less (p<0.0001)

**Interpreting Results**

##### Always Use your residual standard error

**Interpretation template**

For every 1 [unit] increase in [X] [Y] changes by $\Delta X$ 

**More than 2 X's**

After controlling for all other X's ... [see above]

**Example Interpretation**

Given the above example including gender as a factor in our linear model we get a value of -0.64 (-0.79,-.048)

Holding height and age constant, a female is expected to have a FEV value of 0.64 (0.48,0.79) litres less than a male. (p < 0.001)
